I focused on getting the html and css down first.
I did some white boarding at home to figure out how I would want it to look. I started with one look but realized I got way to carried away with the look of the project so I dumbed it down as much as possible and had to switch from the original plan.

After I moved on to the JS portion which drove me CRAZZZY!!!

I made the mistake of not committing as I should have. My issue and what I really need to work on is committing. I get to in what I'm doing and forget to commit. I was also having trouble with getting it deployed with my css.
